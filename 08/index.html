    <h3>Arrow functions</h3>
    <p>difference between normal functions and arrow functions</p>
    
    1. syntax const fun = () => {}
    <br>
    2. arguments keyword not available for arrow funciton, use spread operator
    <br>
    3. hoisting - moves variable, function, class, or import declarations to the top of their scope before the code is executed
    <br>
    hoisting does not work for arrow functions
    4. This keyword 
    <br>in normal funciton this keyword refers to the current object
    <br>in arrow function points to the window object as arrow func
    <br> this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.
